Dear corresponding author,
Thank you again for your submission to the special issue "Researching the Third Sector: Approaches, 
Methods, and Applications" for Voluntas. As you know, we received an unprecedented number of 
outstanding abstracts, and we had difficult choices to make. We had a total of 131 submissions totaling over 
236 authors from all continents, with half of the submissions submitted by women (based on name perception).
While we extend you an invitation to submit a full manuscript by October 31, 2020, we will be sending 
you personalized feedback on your proposal this week to make sure your proposed paper aligns well with the 
goals of the special issue and gets to the peer review stage. These comments should be taken into serious 
consideration as you develop your full manuscript. We will send those this week as we finalize them.
However, in general, we suggest authors presented and described clearly the method or issue at hand, discuss 
more specifically the implications of the method or research issue and that they go beyond one study as an 
application to provide a comprehensive overview to the readers. Our goal as special issue guest editors is to 
support you, and we hope you will not hesitate to contact us with any questions. 
As a reminder, this themed issue has four main goals:

1.	To illustrate the diversity of research approaches in our field of study.
2.	To create a broad repository of short methodological-oriented pieces for scholars and students to cite 
and further their understanding of the nonprofit sector.
3.	To critically analyze the particular considerations when engaging with the sector and ask scholars to 
reflect on the implications of their research on the organizations, processes, and people they study.
4.	To develop a core research community interested in furthering the idea of methodological pluralism 
for the study of our sector. 

The ideal final contribution would be between 4000 to 5000 words, including citations. It would narrow down 
to one particular research issue, theme, method, or approach. To ensure the overall coherence of the themed 
issue and the use of these methodological pieces by other scholars and students of the sector, authors should 
address each of these essential aspects in their contributions:

1.	Define the research issue, method or approach being discussed in the paper. The authors should offer a 
brief overview of the issue/method/approach based on a concise review of the relevant literature.
2.	Provide an assessment of the use of the method/approach in the field, e.g., how it is used in specific 
parts or for specific questions about the third sector. Authors are strongly encouraged to provide an 
application/illustration/example(s) based on their work, examples from VOLUNTAS articles, and/or 
the relevant literature.
3.	Provide an analysis and recommendations regarding how the research issue, method, or approach is 
particularly apt for some third sector research questions or topics.
4.	Discuss the methodological implications/considerations/limitations when studying the third sector 
informed by the assessment and analysis you have presented.

Timeline proposed:

*	October 31, 2020: Submission of 4000-5000-word documents (including citations) to themed issue 
guest editors.
*	January 5, 2020: Papers reviewed by themed issue guest editors and returned to authors with feedback.
*	March 1, 2021: Authors revise their papers for blind peer-review and submit directly to VOLUNTAS.

Thank you again for your submission. We will send you our comments this week and hope you accept our 
invitation to submit your manuscript in light of our forthcoming comments.
Warm wishes,

Paloma Raggo, Ph.D. and Mirae Kim, Ph.D.
Special Issue Guest Editors for Voluntas
