#### Notes

Brody (2012):

```Because of legislation enacted in 2006, the IRS will be able to clean up its Business Master File to weed out those nonfiling small charities that have simply ceased to exist: Effective for tax years beginning in 2007 small organizations that fail to file an annual notice of their continued existence (and minimal other information) for three consecutive years will have their exemption revoked.34 As of 2009, the IRS records showed a total of 1,912,695 exempt organizations (1,238,201 million of which were exempt under section 501(c)(3)). As of mid-2011, the IRS had announced that the net total of automatic revocations exceeded 330,000.35 To ascertain whether these organizations were “in fact defunct or just uninformed and/or confused about IRS regulations,” 36 researchers who had previously reached out to vulnerable Indiana organizations concluded that 27 percent of organizations “that we have reason to believe are still active” lost their exemption for failure to file.
