# Mission Accomplished? A Cross-national Examination of Charity Dissolution

## Data Collection [April - June 2019]

### Australia

#### Notes

Email from Natasha Cortis (06/04/2019):

```A little while back we did do some analysis of ACNC revocation data. The data is poor quality, there are low numbers and at this stage the data is very much an artefact of waves of ACNC efforts to clean up the register. Some of the data we used briefly in a report led by my colleagues Ioana Ramia and Abi Powell https://apo.org.au/node/173046  

The dissolution information we have, as per your framework, is very much a reflection of Australia’s stage of regulatory regime development. When the ACNC started registering charities it inherited a heap of very poorly maintained records from the Tax Office. Then a couple of years later they tried to clean this up, and in 2015 a pile were deregistered as a result of efforts to track the charities down and establish if they were operating or not. We can't tell if the charities that were subsequently removed had been erroneously registered at ACNC inception, or for another reason.

The ACNC's more recent voluntary revocation data could be interesting to look at, as registration and revocation processes can be expected to steady as regulatory arrangements mature. The ACNC data person mentioned recently that they’re trying to improve what they collect when charities leave the register - my instinct is that any improvement is from a very low base, plus they have terrible leadership at the moment and low capacity to do very much -  so its likely to be some time before the data would say anything helpful. But it would be interesting to see how arrangements here stack up in comparative perspective, and to explore the tricky conceptual aspects of all of this, like isn't it simply charities with narrow or achievable missions that are more likely to achieve them?```
