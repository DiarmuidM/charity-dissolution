# Mission Accomplished? A Cross-national Examination of Charity Dissolution

## Data Collection [April - June 2019]

### Key tasks:

1. Write scripts to collect data from the following charity regulators:
	* Charity Commission for England and Wales
	* Charity Commission for Northern Ireland
	* Charities Regulator (Rep. of Ireland)
	* Scottish Charity Regulator
	* Charities Services (New Zealand)
	* Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission
	* Canada Revenue Agency
	* Charity Portal (Singapore)
	* Internal Revenue Service (US)

For Japan and China we are dealing with individuals directly to get access to data.

Efforts should be made to collect as much official data from each regulator e.g. in addition to open data files, scraping the regulator's website for trustee information, identifying whether annual reports are available in PDF form etc.

2. 	Refine and standardise the scripts e.g. create functions, master download files etc.
<br>

3. Capture metadata associated with the data download e.g. produce a schema or table of metadata associated with each jurisdiction's data. For example, the different data sets available, format (i.e. CSV), update schedule, how to collect (via API, file download, scrape etc).

4. Write a file containing the list of Python packages/modules necessary to run the scripts.
